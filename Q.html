        <!-- <h2>Evaluation of Theory Courses</h2>
        <p>All theory courses are evaluated out of 100 marks, distributed as follows:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Attendance and Class Participation: 10 marks</li>
            <li>Continuous Assessments: 30 marks</li>
            <li>Term Final Examination: 60 marks</li>
        </ul> -->

        <h2>Grade Point Average (GPA) Calculation</h2>
        <p>GPA is the weighted average of Grade Points obtained in all courses completed by a student. For example, if a
            student has passed five courses in a term with the following credits and grade points:</p>
        <table>
            <thead>

                </tr>

                <tr>
                    <td>D</td>
                    <td>2</td>

                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>
        <p>The GPA for the term is calculated as:</p>
        <p class="code"> = (3*4.0 + 3*3.0 + 3*3.75 + 2*3.25 + 1*3.5) / (3 + 3 + 3 + 2 + 1) = 3.52</p>

        <h2>What is TGPA, YGPA and CGPA</h2>
        <p>A student's performance is evaluated in terms of three indices:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Term Grade Point Average (TGPA):</strong> Calculated by dividing the total grade points earned
                in a term by the number of credits taken in that term.</li>
            <li><strong>Yearly Grade Point Average (YGPA):</strong> Calculated by dividing the total grade points earned
                in two terms in a year by the total credits taken in that year.</li>
            <li><strong>Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA):</strong> Calculated by dividing the total grade points
                accumulated till date by the total completed credits.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For example, a student who has earned 275 grade points in attempting 100 credits of courses would have an
            overall CGPA of 2.75.</p>

        <h2>How to Use the TGPA Calculator?</h2>
        <p>The TGPA calculator is designed to help you estimate your term GPA based on your estimated marks for each
            subject. Follow these steps to use the calculator:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Enter your estimated marks for each subject in the input fields provided.</li>
            <li>Click the "CALCULATE TGPA" button at the bottom of the form.</li>
            <li>Your estimated TGPA will be displayed on the screen.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Here's a visual representation:</p>

        <h2>Using the Built-in Calculator</h2>
        <p>To get and add average CT marks , Attendance marks and Term Final marks a simple calculator at the bottom right corner will
            help. To use it:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Click on the calculator icon to open the calculator.</li>
            <li>Use the basic functions (add, subtract, multiply, divide) to perform calculations.</li>
            <li>Click on the icon again or cross button to close the calculator.</li>
        </ul>
